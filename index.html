            I watched over 6 and 1/2 seasons of the Walking Dead this Winter Break. I went with Rick and the gang from Atlanta, to the farm, to the prison, back to Atlanta, to Terminus, and to Alexandria, all while characters die while being replaced by new ones. I watched an Asian guy and a ginger get their heads bashed in by a guy who whistles a lot and says that he slid his dick down someone's throat and they said thank you (In a metaphorical way)
